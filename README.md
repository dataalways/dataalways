- Iâ€™m dataalways ðŸ‘‹ and I run an Ethereum focused [Substack](dataalways.substack.com).
- I spend my time doing data analysis and theorycrafting in the cryptocurrency space.
- My niche is taking other people's theories and then looking at the data to see if it supports or disagrees with the claim, ie: 
  -  Is the Ethereum [withdrawal unlock](https://dataalways.substack.com/p/ethereum-validator-withdrawals) going to be a cataclysmic event? 
  -  How does Bitcoin [correlate with broad market volatility](https://dataalways.substack.com/p/is-bitcoin-long-volatility) during panics? 
  -  How valid are the assumptions in the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index? 
  -  At what number of validators does Ethereum staking start to become [less capitally efficient](https://dataalways.substack.com/p/staking-yield-and-ratios)? 
  -  What would [token flows](https://dataalways.substack.com/p/a-flows-based-ethereum-price-model) look like if The Ethereum [Triple Halving model](https://twitter.com/SquishChaos/status/1387074095007817730?cxt=HHwWhICz4cqi8L8mAAAA) plays out?
- Right now I'm working on open-sourcing a lot of the scripts and notebooks that I've built, but it has been a longer process than I anticipated.
